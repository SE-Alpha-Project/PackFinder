How to contribute
-----------------

To contribute to the repository, the repository has to be forked into
your own Github account and then cloned to create a local repository in
your machine. The instructions to setup the project is described in
`README <https://github.com/rohitgeddam/PackFinder/blob/main/README.md>`__.
We strongly advice to create a new branch for each of your contribution
which will be merged after the contribution has been reviewed.

Writing Code
------------

Please follow the style guide that has been maintained in the codebase
of the repository. Looking at existing code shoudl help you understand
the structure better. For testing purposes, use unittest. Take a look at
`Testing in
Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/testing/>`__ for
more information. ### Before you push Please ensure you run tests and
flake8 to check for errors before you push to github. Use black to
format code.

Pull request process
--------------------

1. Make a pull before pushing the changes to a new branch that is
   dedicated for the change you are going to make.
2. After pushing your contribution to the new branch, make sure all
   tests are passing before making a pull request to merge the changes
   with the develop branch. Owners of the repository will look out for
   new Pull Requests and review them timely. Another layer of merge
   happens from develop to main branch after final review.
3. Kindly add required documentation in README.md and comment on the PRs
   to elaborate on the changes that were made.

Additional tips!

1. Report a bug by opening an Issue on Github. Be specific about the
   bug; Talk about the difference in functionality from what is expected
   to what has happened.
2. If you are fixing a bug, make sure you add a test and ensure that it
   fails before you go fix the bug.
3. Always add a test.
4. If it is a new feature, open an issue to discuss it with any of the
   maintainers.
